VALIDATION_ERROR_00000~^~N~^~Unknown~^~vkGetInstanceProcAddr~^~For more information refer to Vulkan Spec Section '3.1. Command Function Pointers' which states 'If instance is not NULL, instance must be a valid VkInstance handle' (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vkGetInstanceProcAddr)~^~implicit, This can't be validated in a layer. Validation would have to occur in a loader.
VALIDATION_ERROR_00001~^~N~^~Unknown~^~vkGetInstanceProcAddr~^~For more information refer to Vulkan Spec Section '3.1. Command Function Pointers' which states 'pName must be a null-terminated string' (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vkGetInstanceProcAddr)~^~implicit, The loader uses strcmp to dispatch and can fail to dispatch when name is not null-terminated. i.e. Validation layers are never called.
VALIDATION_ERROR_00002~^~N~^~Unknown~^~vkGetDeviceProcAddr~^~For more information refer to Vulkan Spec Section '3.1. Command Function Pointers' which states 'device must be a valid VkDevice handle' (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vkGetDeviceProcAddr)~^~implicit
VALIDATION_ERROR_00003~^~N~^~Unknown~^~vkGetDeviceProcAddr~^~For more information refer to Vulkan Spec Section '3.1. Command Function Pointers' which states 'pName must be a null-terminated string' (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vkGetDeviceProcAddr)~^~implicit, The loader uses strcmp to dispatch and can fail to dispatch when name is not null-terminated. i.e. Validation layers are never called.
VALIDATION_ERROR_00004~^~N~^~Unknown~^~vkCreateInstance~^~For more information refer to Vulkan Spec Section '3.2. Instances' which states 'pCreateInfo must be a pointer to a valid VkInstanceCreateInfo structure' (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vkCreateInstance)~^~implicit, We check the sType correctly, but this can cause the loader to seg fault when pCreateInfo is a nullptr.
VALIDATION_ERROR_00005~^~N~^~Unknown~^~vkCreateInstance~^~For more information refer to Vulkan Spec Section '3.2. Instances' which states 'If pAllocator is not NULL, pAllocator must be a pointer to a valid VkAllocationCallbacks structure' (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vkCreateInstance)~^~implicit, A bad pointer can cause the loader to seg fault. Unfortunately, the validity of the allocator is hard to determine. The structure does not contain an sType and is not created by the Vulkan API. We could try to catch an access violation exception but the loader is written in C, which does not support exceptions. It's not clear if this could be validated in a layer before loader consumption. We could also try to install a signal handler in the loader.

Instances' which states 'pInstance must be a pointer to a VkInstance handle' (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-extensions/html/vkspec.html#vkCreateInstance)~^~implicit, How should this be validated? Aside from insidious type-casting, the type will be validated by the compiler. The instance has not been created yet and will likely have no presence in the layers.

This can't be validated in a layer. Validataion would have to occur in a loader.
