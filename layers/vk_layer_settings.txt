# This is an example vk_layer_settings.txt file.
#  This file allows for per-layer settings which can dynamically affect layer
#  behavior. Comments in this file are denoted with the "#" char.
#  Settings lines are of the form "<LayerName><SettingName> = <SettingValue>"
#  There are some common settings that are used by each layer.
#  Below is a general description of three common settings, followed by
#  actual template settings for each layer in the SDK.
#
# Common settings description:
# <LayerName>DebugAction : This is an enum value indicating what action is to
#  be taken when a layer wants to report information. Possible settings values
#  are defined in the vk_layer.h header file. These settings are:
#  VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_IGNORE - Take no action
#  VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG - Log a txt message to stdout or to a log file
#     specified via the <LayerName>LogFilename setting (see below)
#  VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_CALLBACK - Call user defined callback function(s) that
#     have been registered via the vkDbgCreateMsgCallback() extension. Since
#     app must register callback, this is a NOOP for the settings file.
#  VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_BREAK - Trigger a breakpoint.
#
# <LayerName>ReportFlags : This is a comma-delineated list of options telling
#  the layer what types of messages it should report back. Options are:
#  info - Report informational messages
#  warn - Report warnings of using the API in an unrecommended manner which may
#     also lead to undefined behavior
#  perf - Report using the API in a way that may cause suboptimal performance
#  error - Report errors in API usage
#  debug - For layer development. Report messages for debugging layer behavior
#
# <LayerName>LogFilename : output filename. Can be relative to location of
#    vk_layer_settings.txt file, or an absolute path. If no filename is
#    specified or if filename has invalid path, then stdout is used by default.
#
# Example of actual settings for each layer
#
# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_DeviceLimits Settings
DeviceLimitsDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
DeviceLimitsReportFlags = error,warn,perf
DeviceLimitsLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_DrawState Settings
DrawStateDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
DrawStateReportFlags = error,warn,perf
DrawStateLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_Image Settings
ImageDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
ImageReportFlags = error,warn,perf
ImageLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_MemTracker Settings
MemTrackerDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
MemTrackerReportFlags = error,warn,perf
MemTrackerLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_ObjectTracker Settings
ObjectTrackerDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
ObjectTrackerReportFlags = error,warn,perf
ObjectTrackerLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_ParamChecker Settings
ParamCheckerDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
ParamCheckerReportFlags = error,warn,perf
ParamCheckerLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_ShaderChecker Settings
ShaderCheckerDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
ShaderCheckerReportFlags = error,warn,perf
ShaderCheckerLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_Swapchain Settings
SwapchainDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
SwapchainReportFlags = error,warn,perf
SwapchainLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_Threading Settings
ThreadingDebugAction = VK_DBG_LAYER_ACTION_LOG_MSG
ThreadingReportFlags = error,warn,perf
ThreadingLogFilename = stdout

# VK_LUNARG_LAYER_APIDump Settings - NOTE that VK_LUNARG_LAYER_APIDump is
# not a validation layer and the common settings for ReportFlags and
# DebugAction do not apply
# Detailed TRUE causes parameter details to be dumped in addition to API calls
APIDumpDetailed = TRUE
# NoAddr TRUE causes "address" to be dumped in place of hex addresses
APIDumpNoAddr = FALSE
# File = TRUE indicates that output should be written to file instead of STDOUT
APIDumpFile = FALSE
# LogFilename is file to dump to when "File = TRUE" default is "vk_apidump.txt"
APIDumpLogFilename = stdout
# Flush = TRUE causes IO to be flushed after each line that's written
APIDumpFlush = FALSE
