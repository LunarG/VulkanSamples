# Validation Layer Details

## VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation

### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation Overview

This is a meta-layer managed by the loader. Specifying this layer name will cause the loader to load the all of the standard validation layers in the following optimal order:

 - VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_threading
 - VK_LAYER_LUNARG_parameter_validation
 - VK_LAYER_LUNARG_device_limits
 - VK_LAYER_LUNARG_object_tracker
 - VK_LAYER_LUNARG_image
 - VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation
 - VK_LAYER_LUNARG_swapchain
 - VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_unique_objects

Other layers can be specified and the loader will remove duplicates. See the following individual layer descriptions for layer details.

## VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation

### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation Overview

The VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation layer is the main layer performing state tracking, object and state lifetime validation, and consistency and coherency between these states and the requirements, limits, and capabilities. Currently, it is divided into three main areas of validation:  Draw State, Memory Tracking, and Shader Checking.

### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation Draw State Details Table
The Draw State portion of the core validation layer tracks state leading into Draw commands. This includes the Pipeline state, dynamic state, shaders, and descriptor set state. This functionality validates the consistency and correctness between and within these states.

| Check | Overview | ENUM DRAWSTATE_* | Relevant API | Testname | Notes/TODO |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| Valid Pipeline Layouts | Verify that sets being bound are compatible with their PipelineLayout and that the last-bound PSO PipelineLayout at Draw time is compatible with all bound sets used by that PSO | PIPELINE_LAYOUTS_INCOMPATIBLE | vkCmdDraw vkCmdDrawIndexed vkCmdDrawIndirect vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect | TBD | None |
| Valid BeginCommandBuffer state | Must not call Begin on command buffers that are being recorded, and primary command buffers must specify VK_NULL_HANDLE for RenderPass or Framebuffer parameters, while secondary command buffers must provide non-null parameters,  | BEGIN_CB_INVALID_STATE | vkBeginCommandBuffer | PrimaryCommandBufferFramebufferAndRenderpass SecondaryCommandBufferFramebufferAndRenderpass | None |
| Command Buffer Simultaneous Use | Violation of VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT rules. Most likely attempting to simultaneously use a CmdBuffer w/o having that bit set. This also warns if you add secondary command buffer w/o that bit set to a primary command buffer that does have that bit set. | INVALID_CB_SIMULTANEOUS_USE | vkQueueSubmit vkCmdExecuteCommands | TODO | Write test |
| Valid Command Buffer Reset | Can only reset individual command buffer that was allocated from a pool with VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT set | INVALID_COMMAND_BUFFER_RESET | vkBeginCommandBuffer vkResetCommandBuffer | CommandBufferResetErrors | None |
| PSO Bound | Verify that a properly created and valid pipeline object is bound to the CommandBuffer specified in these calls | NO_PIPELINE_BOUND | vkCmdBindDescriptorSets vkCmdBindVertexBuffers | PipelineNotBound | This check is currently more related to VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation internal data structures and less about verifying that PSO is bound at all appropriate points in API.

### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation Draw State Pending Work
Additional Draw State-related checks to be added:

 1. Lifetime validation (See [bug 13383](https://cvs.khronos.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13383))
 2. GetRenderAreaGranularity - The pname:renderPass parameter must be the same as the one given in the sname:VkRenderPassBeginInfo structure for which the render area is relevant.
 3. Update Gfx Pipe Create Info shadowing to remove new/delete and instead use unique_ptrs for auto clean-up
 4. Add validation for Pipeline Derivatives (see Pipeline Derivatives) section of the spec
 
 See the Khronos github repository for Vulkan-LoaderAndValidationLayers for additional pending issues, or to submit new validation requests


### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation Shader Checker Details Table
The Shader Checker portion of the VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation layer inspects the SPIR-V shader images and fixed function pipeline stages at PSO creation time.
It flags errors when inconsistencies are found across interfaces between shader stages. The exact behavior of the checksdepends on the pair of pipeline stages involved.

| Check | Overview | ENUM SHADER_CHECKER_* | Relevant API | Testname | Notes/TODO |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| Not consumed | Flag warning if a location is not consumed (useless work) | OUTPUT_NOT_CONSUMED | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | CreatePipeline*NotConsumed | NA |
| Not produced | Flag error if a location is not produced (consumer reads garbage) | INPUT_NOT_PRODUCED | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | CreatePipeline*NotProvided | NA |
| Type mismatch | Flag error if a location has inconsistent types | INTERFACE_TYPE_MISMATCH | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | CreatePipeline*TypeMismatch | Between shader stages, an exact structural type match is required. Between VI and VS, or between FS and CB, only the basic component type must match (float for UNORM/SNORM/FLOAT, int for SINT, uint for UINT) as the VI and CB stages perform conversions to the exact format. |
| Inconsistent shader | Flag error if an inconsistent SPIR-V image is detected. Possible cases include broken type definitions which the layer fails to walk. | INCONSISTENT_SPIRV | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | TODO | All current tests use the reference compiler to produce valid SPIRV images from GLSL. |
| Non-SPIRV shader | Flag warning if a non-SPIR-V shader image is detected. This can occur if early drivers are ingesting GLSL. VK_LAYER_LUNARG_ShaderChecker cannot analyze non-SPIRV shaders, so this suppresses most other checks. | NON_SPIRV_SHADER | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | TODO | NA |
| VI Binding Descriptions | Validate that there is a single vertex input binding description for each binding | INCONSISTENT_VI | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | CreatePipelineAttribBindingConflict | NA |

| Shader Specialization | Error if specialization entry data is not fully contained within the specialization data block. | BAD_SPECIALIZATION | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines vkCreateComputePipelines | TBD | NA |
| Missing Descriptor | Flags error if shader attempts to use a descriptor binding not declared in the layout | MISSING_DESCRIPTOR | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | CreatePipelineUniformBlockNotProvided | NA |
| Missing Entrypoint | Flags error if specified entrypoint is not present in the shader module | MISSING_ENTRYPOINT | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | TBD | NA |
| Push constant out of range | Flags error if a member of a push constant block is not contained within a push constant range specified in the pipeline layout | PUSH_CONSTANT_OUT_OF_RANGE | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | CreatePipelinePushContantsNotInLayout | NA |
| Push constant not accessible from stage | Flags error if the push constant range containing a push constant block member is not accessible from the current shader stage. | PUSH_CONSTANT_NOT_ACCESSIBLE_FROM_STAGE | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | TBD | NA |
| Descriptor not accessible from stage | Flags error if a descriptor used by a shader stage does not include that stage in its stageFlags | DESCRIPTOR_NOT_ACCESSIBLE_FROM_STAGE | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | TBD | NA |
| Descriptor type mismatch | Flags error if a descriptor type does not match the shader resource type. | DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_MISMATCH | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | TBD | NA |
| Feature not enabled | Flags error if a capability declared by the shader requires a feature not enabled on the device | FEATURE_NOT_ENABLED | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | TBD | NA |
| Bad capability | Flags error if a capability declared by the shader is not supported by Vulkan shaders | BAD_CAPABILITY | vkCreateGraphicsPipelines | TBD | NA |
| NA | Enum used for informational messages | NONE | | NA | None |

### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation Shader Checker Pending Work
- Additional test cases for variously broken SPIRV images
- Validation of a single SPIRV image in isolation (the spec describes many constraints)

### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation Memory Tracker Details Table
The Mem Tracker portion of the VK_LAYER_LUNARG_core_validation layer tracks memory objects and references and validates that they are managed correctly by the application.  This includes tracking object bindings, memory hazards, and memory object lifetimes. Several other hazard-related issues related to command buffers, fences, and memory mapping are also validated in this layer segment.

| Objects Not Destroyed Warning | Warns if any memory objects have not been freed before their objects are destroyed | MEM_OBJ_CLEAR_EMPTY_BINDINGS | vkDestroyDevice | TBD | NA |
| Memory Map Range Checks | Validates that Memory Mapping Requests are valid for the Memory Object (in-range, not currently mapped on Map, currently mapped on UnMap, size is non-zero) | INVALID_MAP | vkMapMemory | TBD | NA |
| NA | Enum used for informational messages | NONE | | NA | None |
| NA | Enum used for errors in the layer itself. This does not indicate an app issue, but instead a bug in the layer. | INTERNAL_ERROR | | NA | None |

### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_parameter_validation Pending Work
Additional work to be done

 1. Source2 was creating a VK_FORMAT_R8_SRGB texture (and image view) which was not supported by the underlying implementation (rendersystemtest imageformat test).  Checking that formats are supported by the implementation is something the validation layer could do using the VK_FORMAT_INFO_TYPE_PROPERTIES query.   There are probably a bunch of checks here you could be doing around vkCreateImage formats along with whether image/color/depth attachment views are valid.  I’m not sure how much of this is already there.
 2. From AMD: we were using an image view with a swizzle of VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_FORMAT_A with a BC1_RGB texture, which is not valid because the texture does not have an alpha channel.  In general, should validate that the swizzles do not reference components not in the texture format.
 3. When querying VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_INFO_TYPE_QUEUE_PROPERTIES must provide enough memory for all the queues on the device (not just 1 when device has multiple queues).
 4. INT & FLOAT bordercolors. Border color int/float selection must match associated texture format.
 5. Flag error on VkBufferCreateInfo if buffer size is 0
 6. VkImageViewCreateInfo.format must be set
 7. For vkCreateGraphicsPipelines, correctly handle array of pCreateInfos and array of pStages within each element of pCreatInfos
 8. Check for valid VkIndexType in vkCmdBindIndexBuffer() should be in PreCmdBindIndexBuffer() call
 9. Check for valid VkPipelineBindPoint in vkCmdBindPipeline() & vkCmdBindDescriptorSets() should be in PreCmdBindPipeline() & PreCmdBindDescriptorSets() calls respectively.

## VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_threading

### VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_threading Overview

The VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_threading layer checks for simultaneous use of objects by calls from multiple threads.
Application code is responsible for preventing simultaneous use of the same objects by certain calls that modify objects.
See [bug 13433](https://cvs.khronos.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13433) and
<https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/oglc/trunk/nextgen/vulkan/function_properties.csv>
for threading rules.
Objects that may need a mutex include VkQueue, VkDeviceMemory, VkObject, VkBuffer, VkImage, VkDescriptorSet, VkDescriptorPool, VkCommandBuffer, and VkSemaphore.
The most common case is that a VkCommandBuffer passed to VkCmd* calls must be used by only one thread at a time.

In addition to reporting threading rule violations, the layer will enforce a mutex for those calls.
That can allow an application to continue running without actually crashing due to the reported threading problem.

The layer can only observe when a mutual exclusion rule is actually violated.
It cannot insure that there is no latent race condition needing mutual exclusion.

The layer can also catch reentrant use of the same object by calls from a single thread.
That might happen if Vulkan calls are made from a callback function or a signal handler.
But the layer cannot prevent such a reentrant use of an object.

The layer can only observe when a mutual exclusion rule is actually violated.
It cannot insure that there is no latent race condition.

## VK_LAYER_LUNARG_device_limits

### VK_LAYER_LUNARG_device_limits Overview

This layer is a work in progress. VK_LAYER_LUNARG_device_limits layer is intended to capture two broad categories of errors:
 1. Incorrect use of APIs to query device capabilities
 2. Attempt to use API functionality beyond the capability of the underlying device

For the first category, the layer tracks which calls are made and flags errors if calls are excluded that should not be, or if call sequencing is incorrect. An example is an app that assumes attempts to Query and use queues without ever having called vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties(). Also, if an app is calling vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties() to retrieve properties with some assumed count for array size instead of first calling vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties() w/ a NULL pQueueFamilyProperties parameter in order to query the actual count.
For the second category of errors, VK_LAYER_LUNARG_device_limits stores its own internal record of underlying device capabilities and flags errors if requests are made beyond those limits. Most (all?) of the limits are queried via vkGetPhysicalDevice* calls.

## VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_unique_objects

### VK_LAYER_GOOGLE_unique_objects Overview

The unique_objects is not a validation layer but a helper layer that assists with validation. The Vulkan specification allows objects that have non-unique handles. This makes tracking object lifetimes difficult in that it is unclear which object is being referenced upon deletion. The unique_objects layer addresses this by wrapping all objects with a unique object representation allowing proper object lifetime tracking. This layer does no validation on its own and may not be required for the proper operation of all layers or all platforms. One sign that it is needed is the appearance of many errors from the object_tracker layer indicating the use of previously destroyed objects. For optimal effectiveness this layer should be loaded last (to reside in the layer chain closest to the display driver and farthest from the application).


## General Pending Work
A place to capture general validation work to be done. This includes new checks that don't clearly fit into the above layers.

 1. For Upcoming Dynamic State overhaul (if approved): If dynamic state value that is consumed is never set prior to consumption, flag an error
 2. For Upcoming Dynamic State overhaul (if approved): If dynamic state that was bound as "static" in current PSO is attempted to be set with vkCmdSet* flag an error
 3. Need to check VkShaderCreateInfo.stage is being set properly (Issue reported by Dan G)
