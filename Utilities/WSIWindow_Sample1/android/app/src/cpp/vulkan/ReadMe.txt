This folder contains Vulkan header version 32, and is only required if you are 
targeting rare android-23(Marshmallow 6.0) devices which have Vulkan support, 
such as the NVidia Shield tablet.

The NDK already contains its own copy of the Vulkan header(v22) for android-24(Nougat 7.0).
If you are only targeting android-24 and up, this folder may be deleted.
