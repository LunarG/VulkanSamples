your contribution in a fork of this repository in your GitHub account and then
submit a pull request. Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file
in this repository for more details.

## Repository Content

This repository contains the source code necessary to build the LunarG
Vulkan Samples
 - The Vulkan Samples repo is a set of source and data files in a specific
    directory hierarchy:
      - API-Samples - Samples that demonstrate the use of various aspects of the
        Vulkan API
      - Vulkan Tutorial - Steps you through the process of creating a simple Vulkan application, learning the basics along the way. This [Vulkan Tutorial link](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/windows/tutorial/html/index.html) allows you to view the Vulkan Tutorial on LunarXchange as well. 
      - Sample-Programs - Samples that are more functional and go deeper than simple API use.
      - Layer-Samples - Samples that are implemented as layers.  The Overlay layer sample is deprecated and does not build.

## Repository Set-Up

### Display Drivers

This repository does not contain a Vulkan-capable driver. You will need to
obtain and install a Vulkan driver from your graphics hardware vendor or from
some other suitable source if you intend to run Vulkan applications.

### Download the Repository

To create your local git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/LunarG/VulkanSamples.git

### Repository Dependencies

This repository attempts to resolve some of its dependencies by using
components found from the following places, in this order:

1. CMake or Environment variable overrides (e.g., -DVULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR)
1. LunarG Vulkan SDK, located by the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable
1. System-installed packages, mostly applicable on Linux

Dependencies that cannot be resolved by the SDK or installed packages must be
resolved with the "install directory" override and are listed below. The
"install directory" override can also be used to force the use of a specific
version of that dependency.

#### Vulkan-Headers

This repository has a required dependency on the
[Vulkan Headers repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers).
You must clone the headers repository and build its `install` target before
building this repository. The Vulkan-Headers repository is required because it
contains the Vulkan API definition files (registry) that are required to build
the samples. You must also take note of the headers' install
directory and pass it on the CMake command line for building this repository,
as described below.

#### glslangValidator and spirv-as
The samples use glslangValidator to compile glsl shaders and spirv-as to assemble
spirv assembly code.  CMake is set up to fetch these executables if they are not 
found in your PATH.

#### Vulkan-Loader

The samples depend on the Vulkan loader when they execute and
so a loader is needed only if the tests are built and run.

A loader can be used from an installed LunarG SDK, an installed Linux package,
or from a driver installation on Windows.

If a loader is not available from any of these methods and/or it is important
to use a loader built from a repository, then you must build the
[Vulkan-Loader repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader.git)
with its install target. Take note of its install directory location and pass
it on the CMake command line for building this repository, as described below.


### Building Dependent Repositories with Known-Good Revisions

There is a Python utility script, `scripts/update_deps.py`, that you can use to
gather and build the dependent repositories mentioned above. This script uses
information stored in the `scripts/known_good.json` file to check out dependent
repository revisions that are known to be compatible with the revision of this
repository that you currently have checked out. As such, this script is useful
as a quick-start tool for common use cases and default configurations.

For all platforms, start with:

    git clone https://github.com/LunarG/VulkanSamples.git
    cd VulkanSamples
    mkdir build
    cd build

For 64-bit Linux, continue with:

    ../scripts/update_deps.py
    cmake -C helper.cmake ..
    cmake --build .

For 64-bit Windows, continue with:

    ..\scripts\update_deps.py --arch x64
    cmake -A x64 -C helper.cmake ..
    cmake --build .

For 32-bit Windows, continue with:

    ..\scripts\update_deps.py --arch Win32
    cmake -A Win32 -C helper.cmake ..
    cmake --build .

Please see the more detailed build information later in this file if you have
specific requirements for configuring and building these components.

#### Notes

- You may need to adjust some of the CMake options based on your platform. See
  the platform-specific sections later in this document.
- The `update_deps.py` script fetches and builds the dependent repositories in
  the current directory when it is invoked. In this case, they are built in
  the `build` directory.
- The `build` directory is also being used to build this
  (VulkanSamples) repository. But there shouldn't be any conflicts
  inside the `build` directory between the dependent repositories and the
  build files for this repository.
- The `--dir` option for `update_deps.py` can be used to relocate the
  dependent repositories to another arbitrary directory using an absolute or
  relative path.
- The `update_deps.py` script generates a file named `helper.cmake` and places
  it in the same directory as the dependent repositories (`build` in this
  case). This file contains CMake commands to set the CMake `*_INSTALL_DIR`
  variables that are used to point to the install artifacts of the dependent
  repositories. You can use this file with the `cmake -C` option to set these
  variables when you generate your build files with CMake. This lets you avoid
  entering several `*_INSTALL_DIR` variable settings on the CMake command line.
- If using "MINGW" (Git For Windows), you may wish to run
  `winpty update_deps.py` in order to avoid buffering all of the script's
  "print" output until the end and to retain the ability to interrupt script
  execution.
- Please use `update_deps.py --help` to list additional options and read the
  internal documentation in `update_deps.py` for further information.

### Build Options

When generating native platform build files through CMake, several options can
be specified to customize the build. Some of the options are binary on/off
options, while others take a string as input. The following is a table of all
on/off options currently supported by this repository:

| Option | Platform | Default | Description |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| BUILD_API_SAMPLES | All | `ON` | Controls whether or not the basic api samples are built. |
| BUILD_SAMPLE_LAYERS | All | `OFF` | Controls whether or not the Overlay sample layer is built.  The Overlay layer is currently deprcated and will not build. |

These variables should be set using the `-D` option when invoking CMake to
generate the native platform files.

## Building On Windows

### Windows Development Environment Requirements

- Windows
  - Any Personal Computer version supported by Microsoft
- Microsoft [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
  - Versions
    - [2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/)
    - [2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/downloads/)
  - The Community Edition of each of the above versions is sufficient, as
    well as any more capable edition.
- [CMake 3.10.2](https://cmake.org/files/v3.10/cmake-3.10.2-win64-x64.zip) is recommended.
  - Use the installer option to add CMake to the system PATH
- Git Client Support
  - [Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/download/win) is a popular solution
    for Windows
  - Some IDEs (e.g., [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/),
    [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)) have integrated
    Git client support

### Windows Build - Microsoft Visual Studio

The general approach is to run CMake to generate the Visual Studio project
files. Then either run CMake with the `--build` option to build from the
command line or use the Visual Studio IDE to open the generated solution and
work with the solution interactively.

#### Use `CMake` to Create the Visual Studio Project Files

Change your current directory to the top of the cloned repository directory,
create a build directory and generate the Visual Studio project files:

    cd VulkanSamples
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -A x64 -DVULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR=absolute_path_to_install_dir \
                 -DVULKAN_LOADER_INSTALL_DIR=absolute_path_to_install_dir \
                 -DGLSLANG_INSTALL_DIR=absolute_path_to_install_dir ..

> Note: The `..` parameter tells `cmake` the location of the top of the
> repository. If you place your build directory someplace else, you'll need to
> specify the location of the repository top differently.

The `-A` option is used to select either the "Win32" or "x64" architecture.

If a generator for a specific version of Visual Studio is required, you can
specify it for Visual Studio 2015, for example, with:

    64-bit: -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
    32-bit: -G "Visual Studio 14 2015"


When generating the project files, the absolute path to a Vulkan-Headers
install directory must be provided. This can be done by setting the
`VULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable or by setting the
`VULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR` CMake variable with the `-D` CMake option. In
either case, the variable should point to the installation directory of a
Vulkan-Headers repository built with the install target.

When generating the project files, the absolute path to a Vulkan-Loader
install directory must be provided. This can be done by setting the
`VULKAN_LOADER_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable or by setting the
`VULKAN_LOADER_INSTALL_DIR` CMake variable with the `-D` CMake option. In
either case, the variable should point to the installation directory of a
Vulkan-Loader repository built with the install target.

When generating the project files, the absolute path to a glslang install
directory must be provided. This can be done by setting the
`GLSLANG_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable or by setting the
`GLSLANG_INSTALL_DIR` CMake variable with the `-D` CMake option. In either
case, the variable should point to the installation directory of a glslang
repository built with the install target.

Note that if you don't want to use specific revisions of HEADERS, LOADER, 
and GLSLANG, the update_deps.py script mentioned above will handle all 
of the dependencies for you.

The above steps create a Windows solution file named
`VulkanSamples.sln` in the build directory.

At this point, you can build the solution from the command line or open the
generated solution with Visual Studio.

#### Build the Solution From the Command Line

While still in the build directory:

    cmake --build .

to build the Debug configuration (the default), or:

    cmake --build . --config Release

to make a Release build.

#### Build the Solution With Visual Studio

Launch Visual Studio and open the "VulkanSamples.sln" solution file
in the build folder. You may select "Debug" or "Release" from the Solution
Configurations drop-down list. Start a build by selecting the Build->Build
Solution menu item.

[CMake 3.10.2](https://cmake.org/files/v3.10/cmake-3.10.2-win64-x64.zip) is recommended.

## Building On Linux

### Linux Build Requirements

This repository has been built and tested on the two most recent Ubuntu LTS
versions. Currently, the oldest supported version is Ubuntu 16.04, meaning
that the minimum officially supported C++11 compiler version is GCC 5.4.0,
although earlier versions may work. It should be straightforward to adapt this
repository to other Linux distributions.

#### Required Package List

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential libx11-xcb-dev \
        libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libxrandr-dev

[CMake 3.10.2](https://cmake.org/files/v3.10/cmake-3.10.2-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz) is recommended.

### Linux Build

The general approach is to run CMake to generate make files. Then either run
CMake with the `--build` option or `make` to build from the command line.


#### Use CMake to Create the Make Files

Change your current directory to the top of the cloned repository directory,
create a build directory and generate the make files.

    cd Vulkan-Samples
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
          -DVULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR=absolute_path_to_install_dir \
          -DVULKAN_LOADER_INSTALL_DIR=absolute_path_to_install_dir \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install ..

> Note: The `..` parameter tells `cmake` the location of the top of the
> repository. If you place your `build` directory someplace else, you'll need
> to specify the location of the repository top differently.

Use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to specify a Debug or Release build.

When generating the project files, the absolute path to a Vulkan-Headers
install directory must be provided. This can be done by setting the
`VULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable or by setting the
`VULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR` CMake variable with the `-D` CMake option. In
either case, the variable should point to the installation directory of a
Vulkan-Headers repository built with the install target.

When generating the project files, the absolute path to a Vulkan-Loader
install directory must be provided. This can be done by setting the
`VULKAN_LOADER_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable or by setting the
`VULKAN_LOADER_INSTALL_DIR` CMake variable with the `-D` CMake option. In
either case, the variable should point to the installation directory of a
Vulkan-Headers repository built with the install target.

Note that if you don't want to use specific revisions of HEADERS or LOADER,
the update_deps.py script mentioned above will handle all
of the dependencies for you.

#### Build the Project

You can just run `make` to begin the build.

To speed up the build on a multi-core machine, use the `-j` option for `make`
to specify the number of cores to use for the build. For example:

    make -j4

You can also use

    cmake --build .

If your build system supports ccache, you can enable that via CMake option `-DUSE_CCACHE=On`

### Linux Notes

#### WSI Support Build Options

By default, the repository components are built with support for the
Vulkan-defined WSI display servers: Xcb, Xlib, and Wayland. It is recommended
to build the repository components with support for these display servers to
maximize their usability across Linux platforms. If it is necessary to build
these modules without support for one of the display servers, the appropriate
CMake option of the form `BUILD_WSI_xxx_SUPPORT` can be set to `OFF`.

## Building On Android

Install the required tools for Linux and Windows covered above, then add the
following.

- Build shaderc source code inside NDK
```java
$ cd ${ndk_root}/sources/third_party/shaderc
$ ../../../ndk-build NDK_PROJECT_PATH=. APP_BUILD_SCRIPT=Android.mk APP_STL:=c++_static APP_ABI=all NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION:=clang libshaderc_combined -j16
```
- Generate Android Studio Projects
```java
$ cd YOUR_DEV_DIRECTORY/VulkanSamples/API-Samples
$ cmake -DANDROID=ON -DABI_NAME=<armeabi-v7a|arm64-v8a|...>
```
- Import VulkanSamples/API-Samples/android/build.gradle into Android Studio 2.3.0+.
- Or if building from a terminal:
```java
$ cd android
$ ./gradlew build
```
