# Vulkan Samples
  - This repository is a collection of Vulkan C++ sample applications.
  - Run the following script to obtain a short description of all or a 
    specific sample:
    `$ API-Samples/get-short-descripts.sh`
  - Run the following script to obtain a more detailed description of all
    samples with a long description set:
    `$ API-Samples/get-descripts.sh`

## Structure

Vulkan Samples
 - The Vulkan Samples repo is a set of source and data files in a specific
    directory hierarchy:
      - API-Samples - Samples that demonstrate the use of various aspects of the
        Vulkan API
      - Vulkan Tutorial - Steps you through the process of creating a simple Vulkan application, learning the basics along the way. This [Vulkan Tutorial link](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/windows/tutorial/html/index.html) allows you to view the Vulkan Tutorial on LunarXchange as well. 
      - Sample-Programs - Samples that are more functional and go deeper than simple API use.
      - Layer-Samples - Samples that are implemented as layers.  The Overlay layer sample is deprecated and does not build.
	  
## Sample progression
  - In general, the samples are not interrelated, but there is a progression
      among some of the samples that lead to drawing a cube.  Start with the
      instance sample, then enumerate-adv, device, initcommandbuffer, initswapchain, initdepthbuffer,
      inituniformbuffer, descriptor_pipeline_layouts, initrenderpass, initshaders,
      initframebuffers, vertexbuffer, allocdescriptorsets, initpipeline, and they
      culminate in the drawcube sample.  Each sample uses utility routines from
      the code from previous samples to get to the point to show something new.
      The drawtexturedcube sample takes all of the drawcube code and adds texturing.

## How to Build and Run

[BUILD.md](BUILD.md)
Includes directions for building all components as well as running validation tests and demo applications.

## Version Tagging Scheme

Updates to the `LunarG-VulkanSamples` repository which correspond to a new Vulkan specification release are tagged using the following format: `v<`_`version`_`>` (e.g., `v1.1.96`).

**Note**: Marked version releases have undergone thorough testing but do not imply the same quality level as SDK tags. SDK tags follow the `sdk-<`_`version`_`>.<`_`patch`_`>` format (e.g., `sdk-1.1.92.0`).

This scheme was adopted following the 1.1.96 Vulkan specification release.
